# Phase 3 Project - Avatar Creator Frontend Repo

# Dev: Wesley Grant

Welcome to my phase 3 project for FlatIron School's software development program.

Frontend Deployed here: https://p3av-creator.herokuapp.com/

This has a super simple React frontend as the project was mainly focused around Sinatra and creating a backend.

Insert image (preferably .pngs) image addresses of different body parts to create a custom avatar!

# Future plans:

- add adjustable image sliders
- add user login
- add galleries
- all the CSS!

Thanks for checking it out. This is my first official fullstack project.
